## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/teacherpro.git
cd teacherpro
````

---
### ✉️ Email Setup (Gmail)
The backend uses Gmail SMTP to send real-time notifications. You need to enable it:

Generate App Password:

Go to your Google Account

Go to Security > 2-Step Verification (turn it on)

Go to App Passwords

Select Mail and your device, then generate a password

Copy the generated password

Replace in application.yml:

yaml
Copy code
spring:
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: your-email@gmail.com
    password: your-generated-app-password
    properties:
      mail:
        smtp:
          auth: true
          starttls:
            enable: true
## Heads up: Don’t push your real credentials to GitHub. Add them in your local application.yml
